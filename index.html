        <h2>Take the guesswork out of sales planning</h2>
        <p>
		  DemandMind brings data-science–grade forecasting to every merchant. Built on proven open-source
		  forecasting technology, it predicts future sales at the SKU level — and adapts as your store grows.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Unlike static one-time forecast tools, DemandMind updates continuously as new orders arrive. It
		  captures seasonality, promotions, product launches, and short-term spikes automatically, giving you
		  a real-time view of where demand is heading.
		</p>


        <h2>What DemandMind tells you</h2>
        <ul>
		  <li>Which SKUs are expected to sell in the next 7, 30, and 60 days.</li>
		  <li>Which products are slowing down so you can reduce unnecessary restocking.</li>
		  <li>Which items are trending up so you can boost ads, inventory, or purchasing.</li>
		  <li>How your demand is shifting week over week.</li>
		  <li>Which products deserve priority based on forecasted demand, not guesswork.</li>
		</ul>


        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
		  <li>Install DemandMind and securely connect your store.</li>
		  <li>We analyze your historical orders and run adaptive AI forecasts.</li>
		  <li>Your dashboard updates automatically as new orders come in.</li>
		</ol>


        <h2>Who it's for</h2>
		<p>
		  Merchants at any stage — new stores, scaling brands, or high-volume multi-SKU operations —
		  that need reliable, SKU-level sales forecasts to plan inventory, avoid stockouts,
		  minimize overstock, and make confident purchasing and marketing decisions without hiring
		  an analyst or relying on spreadsheets.

    <section class="section faq">
      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Does DemandMind work for new stores with limited data?</h3>
	  <p>
		Yes — DemandMind uses adaptive modeling. As your store grows and collects more order history,
		your forecasts become more precise automatically.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Will this slow down my store?</h3>
	  <p>
		No. DemandMind does not modify your theme or affect storefront performance. All forecasting is
		processed securely off your storefront.
	   </p>

	   <h3>What if I add new products?</h3>
	   <p>
		DemandMind adapts automatically. New SKUs begin forecasting as soon as they collect enough order
		history to generate meaningful predictions.
		</p>

		<h3>Can I use these forecasts for purchasing and marketing plans?</h3>
		<p>
		  Yes. DemandMind is designed to support inventory planning, restock timing, promotion strategy,
		  and budgeting decisions with data-driven confidence.
