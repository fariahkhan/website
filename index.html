        <h2>Take the guesswork out of sales planning</h2>
        <p>
		  DemandMind brings data-science–grade forecasting to every merchant. Built on proven open-source
		  forecasting technology, it predicts future sales at the SKU level — and adapts as your store grows.
		</p>

		<p>
		  Unlike static one-time forecast tools, DemandMind updates continuously as new orders arrive. It
		  captures seasonality, promotions, product launches, and short-term spikes automatically, giving you
		  a real-time view of where demand is heading.
		</p>


        <h2>What DemandMind tells you</h2>
        <ul>
		  <li>Which SKUs are expected to sell in the next 7, 30, and 60 days.</li>
		  <li>Which products are slowing down so you can reduce unnecessary restocking.</li>
		  <li>Which items are trending up so you can boost ads, inventory, or purchasing.</li>
		  <li>How your demand is shifting week over week.</li>
		  <li>Which products deserve priority based on forecasted demand, not guesswork.</li>
		</ul>


        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
		  <li>Install DemandMind and securely connect your store.</li>
		  <li>We analyze your historical orders and run adaptive AI forecasts.</li>
		  <li>Your dashboard updates automatically as new orders come in.</li>
		</ol>


        <h2>Who it's for</h2>
		<p>
		  Merchants at any stage — new stores, scaling brands, or high-volume multi-SKU operations —
		  that need reliable, SKU-level sales forecasts to plan inventory, avoid stockouts,
		  minimize overstock, and make confident purchasing and marketing decisions without hiring
		  an analyst or relying on spreadsheets.

    <!-- FAQ -->
    <section id="faq" class="section faq reveal">

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Does DemandMind work for new stores with limited data?</h3>
	  <p>
		Yes — DemandMind uses adaptive modeling. As your store grows and collects more order history,
		your forecasts become more precise automatically.
	  </p>

	  <h3>Will this slow down my store?</h3>
	  <p>
		No. DemandMind does not modify your theme or affect storefront performance. All forecasting is
		processed securely off your storefront.
	   </p>

	   <h3>What if I add new products?</h3>
	   <p>
		DemandMind adapts automatically. New SKUs begin forecasting as soon as they collect enough order
		history to generate meaningful predictions.
		</p>

		<h3>Can I use these forecasts for purchasing and marketing plans?</h3>
		<p>
		  Yes. DemandMind is designed to support inventory planning, restock timing, promotion strategy,
		  and budgeting decisions with data-driven confidence.
		</p>
		<h3>Who can benefit from DemandMind?</h3>
		<p>
		  DemandMind is designed for merchants at any stage — from new stores with a growing catalog
		  to established, high-volume brands. If you work with physical inventory, run promotions, or
		  want to avoid stockouts and overstock using data instead of guesswork, DemandMind can help.
		 </p>
		<h3>Do I need a technical or data background to use DemandMind?</h3>
		 <p>
		  No. DemandMind is built for merchants, not data scientists. Forecasts are presented in clear
		  tables and charts, and you can export everything to CSV, Excel, or PDF without any code or
		  modeling setup.
