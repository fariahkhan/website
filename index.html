        <h2>Take the guesswork out of sales planning</h2>
        <p>
          DemandMind uses AI-driven forecasting (built on proven open-source technology) to predict
          upcoming sales by product or SKU. As your store collects more data, its accuracy adapts and improves —
          automatically.
        </p>

        <p>
          Unlike static “one-time forecast” tools, DemandMind refreshes its predictions based on your
          latest orders. Each run captures seasonality, trends, launches, and short-term spikes so you can
          plan stock, marketing, and purchasing with confidence.
        </p>

        <h2>What DemandMind tells you</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Which products are likely to sell in the next 7–60 days.</li>
          <li>Which SKUs are slowing down and may not need restocking immediately.</li>
          <li>Which items are trending up so you can double down before demand peaks.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>How it works</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Install DemandMind and connect your store.</li>
          <li>We sync your historical orders and run AI-based forecasts.</li>
          <li>You get clear tables and charts updated as new orders come in.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Who it's for</h2>
        <p>
          New merchants and growing brands that want ongoing, SKU-level demand forecasts —
          without hiring a data scientist or living in spreadsheets.

      <h2>FAQ</h2>

      <h3>Does DemandMind change my theme or storefront?</h3>
      <p>No. DemandMind only reads your orders data to generate forecasts. It does not modify your theme or storefront.</p>

      <h3>How often are forecasts updated?</h3>
      <p>
        Forecasts are refreshed whenever you sync data, so you can track how demand shifts weekly or monthly as your store evolves.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need to configure models or tune anything?</h3>
      <p>
        No. DemandMind handles the AI and modeling behind the scenes. You just connect your store and read the tables and charts.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I export the forecasts?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes. Depending on your plan, you can export CSV, Excel (XLSX), and PDF snapshots to share with your team or plug into your
        existing reporting workflows.
