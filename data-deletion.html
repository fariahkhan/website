    <h1>Data Deletion Instructions</h1>
    <p>Last updated: October 2025</p>

    <p>
      This Data Deletion Policy explains how DemandMind handles deletion of Shopify store data when you uninstall or request removal.
		Automatic Data Deletion 

		When a merchant uninstalls DemandMind:

		Shopify sends an automatic “app uninstall” webhook

		DemandMind immediately flags all related store data for removal

		All store data is fully deleted from DemandMind systems within 48 hours

		This includes:

		Order history

		SKU/product metadata

		Forecast output

		Logs associated with your store

		Any cached or temporary forecasting data

		We do not retain any identifiable data after deletion.
		
		Data We Do NOT Store

		To protect your privacy:

		We do not store customer names, emails, or personal data

		We do not store payment information

		We do not store any Shopify admin information unrelated to forecasting

		DemandMind only stores what is required to run forecasting models.
