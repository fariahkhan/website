    <h1>Terms of Service</h1>
    <p>Last updated: October 2025</p>

    <p>
      These Terms of Service (“Terms”) govern your use of the DemandMind app (“Service”).
      By installing or using the Service, you agree to these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Use of the Service</h2>
    <p>
      DemandMind provides AI-powered sales forecasting for Shopify merchants. You agree to use the Service
      in compliance with:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Shopify’s Terms of Service</li>
      <li>All applicable laws and regulations</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You may not use DemandMind for illegal or unauthorized purposes.</p>

    <h2>2. Shopify App Installation</h2>
    <p>When you install DemandMind, you grant permission for the app to access:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Order history</li>
      <li>Product &amp; SKU metadata</li>
      <li>Basic store information</li>
    </ul>
    <p>This access is required to generate forecasts.</p>

    <h2>3. Subscription &amp; Billing</h2>
    <p>DemandMind offers tiered subscription plans (Basic, Pro, Plus). By subscribing:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You authorize Shopify to bill you according to your selected plan.</li>
      <li>You understand billing is handled by Shopify, not DemandMind.</li>
      <li>You may upgrade, downgrade, or cancel at any time via your Shopify admin.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Subscriptions auto-renew unless canceled.</p>

    <h2>4. Accuracy of Forecasts</h2>
    <p>
      Forecasts are based on historical data and statistical models. While DemandMind aims for high accuracy:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>No forecast can be guaranteed.</li>
      <li>
        You agree that DemandMind is not responsible for business decisions made based on forecast output.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>The app provides guidance, not guarantees.</p>

    <h2>5. Intellectual Property</h2>
    <p>
      All content and features of DemandMind—including code, design, branding, and forecasting logic—are
      the intellectual property of DemandMind.
    </p>
    <p>You may not:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Copy or reproduce any part of the Service.</li>
      <li>Reverse engineer the forecasting models.</li>
      <li>Redistribute or resell the Service.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>6. Data Rights &amp; Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      DemandMind handles store data in accordance with our Privacy Policy. You retain ownership of your
      Shopify store data at all times.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Termination</h2>
    <p>You may uninstall the app at any time. Upon uninstall:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Your subscription is canceled through Shopify.</li>
      <li>All store-related data is automatically deleted within 48 hours.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      DemandMind may suspend or terminate access for misuse or violations of these Terms.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Limitation of Liability</h2>
    <p>To the fullest extent permitted by law, DemandMind is not liable for:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Loss of profits.</li>
      <li>Inaccurate forecasts.</li>
      <li>Inventory decisions based on forecast output.</li>
      <li>Any indirect or consequential damages.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Service is provided “as is,” without warranties.</p>

    <h2>9. Changes to These Terms</h2>
    <p>
      We may update these Terms periodically. Continued use of the app constitutes agreement to the
      updated Terms.
